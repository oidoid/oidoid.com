In the past, I've donated to
[The Wikimedia Foundation](https://wikimediafoundation.org),
[Linux Mint](https://linuxmint.com), [Tiled](https://mapeditor.org), and
elsewhere.

## Why mention it?

It's often safer to keep one's thoughts to oneself. I share my donations for a
few reasons:

- If I think a project is worth supporting, I think it's worth sharing.
- The default for most works is "never donate." For both myself and others, I
  want to promote contribution.
- I don't think giving even so little is shameful. For myself, feeling ashamed
  about small donations discouraged me more than it encouraged me. It felt like
  automated tests in software development. Sharing my donations might help
  others who feel similarly.
- Hiding donations seems unhelpful and possibly hurtful. I implicitly felt this
  way and never rationally scrutinized it.
- I find it personally motivating to track my donations as a small
  accomplishment.
