Hello, I'm Stephen. Welcome to my so-called website.

Programming is at the center of my life. Mostly TypeScript these days.

I live in Denver, Colorado with my partner, J (who took my photo). I grew up in
Pennsylvania.

My pronouns are he/him.

I had a mix of public and homeschooling as well as a year of commercial arts
vocational school. I graduated with a bachelor's of science in computer
engineering from DigiPen Institute of Technology.

My email is [stephen@oidoid.com](mailto:stephen@oidoid.com).

I work at Reddit on the Developer Platform team. See
[my resume (PDF)](stephen-niedzielski-resume.pdf).

So there you have it.
