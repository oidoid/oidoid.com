I've rewritten my personal website many times in my life. This is another. It's
always with the same sorts of aspirations: 1) build a platform to express myself
easily 2) consolidate my work and ideas in one place that I own 3) connect with
others.

The last two iterations of this website were primitive single file sites that
mostly skipped #1 and linked to other platforms. It was very easy to maintain
that one page but not everything I wish to share fits into the constraints of
that design.

I intentionally took a no modesty approach this iteration so I could finish it
hastily before I start my new job. It's so messy!

I've broken the site up into a few broad sections that fit my plans. It's the
only thing I paused to think about this time:

- Works: technical and nontechnical projects. For example, I think I would put
  my favorite project, swankmania, here even though it may no longer exist and
  the page is more of a postmortem. It's about creating something mostly whole.
  A book would probably go here. A finished drawing would go here.
- Notes: Essays and writings. This directory may encompass a broad range of
  topics from my favorite Nintendo Entertainment System games to comparing
  different TypeScript programming styles.
- Log: My thinking is that writings I put in the log will never be revised
  significantly (and therefore literally less polished). If I might make changes
  to an article, I will try not to put it here. The only other characteristic
  trait of logs is that they'll probably be more focused on a moment in time and
  may be more of a smattering of topics than a deep dive.
- Profile: this is a pretty conventional "about me" page. I may make this more
  in-depth (eg, I could add a photos section), but I think it's more likely to
  stay light.

They all kind of overlap but have worthwhile distinctions.

Lots of work remains but, if nothing else, it was a fun experiment to explore
[Deno](https://deno.land).
